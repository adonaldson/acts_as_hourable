ActsAsHourable
==============

When durations are stored as seconds, it's useful sometimes to deal with the values in hours. For each configured method that returns a number, an extra method will be added that returns the same value, but in hours.

And yes, the name is bad.

Example
=======

class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_hourable :duration
	
	#
	#  Creates a method Task#duration_hours(decimal_places = 1)
	#
	
	or...
	
	acts_as_hourable :estimated_duration, :actual_duration
	
	or...
	
	acts_as_hourable :duration, :decimal_places => 8, :suffix => "_turnip"
	
	#
	#  Creates a method Task#duration_turnip(decimal_places = 8)
	#
end
